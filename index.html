    <p></p>Quantum computing is an emerging technology that uses quantum mechanics to solve complex problems faster than classical computers. 
    In asset management, it shows promise for optimizing investment portfolios, analyzing risks, and pricing derivatives, areas critical for managing financial assets effectively.</p.  
    <h1>Applications and Algorithms </h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Portfolio Optimization: Algorithms like the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), 
        and Quantum Walk Optimization Algorithm (QWOA) help find optimal investment mixes, potentially speeding up solutions for large markets. </li>
    <li>Risk Analysis: Amplitude estimation can calculate risk measures like Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), 
        offering a quadratic speed-up over classical Monte Carlo simulations. </li>    
    <li>Derivative Pricing: Methods like Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) and amplitude estimation reduce resource needs, 
        enhancing the pricing of financial derivatives.</li>
    </ul>
